Sport Locations


This project is designed to help users plan for an effective school/club pathway: encouraging pupils
who are interested in a sport to join their local club.


This will take the form of a map, which shows the locations of schools and clubs. Users can select a sport they are
interested in, and see which schools offer this sport as an extra-curricular activity, if there are any links
to a local club where pupils can continue their participation in the community, and if not, identify some
local clubs.
